# Rock Inscription Letter Extraction AI Model

Welcome to the Rock Inscription Letter Extraction AI Model repository! This project aims to develop a robust AI model capable of automatically extracting individual letters from images of rock inscriptions using OpenCV and Python.

## Overview

Rock inscriptions hold invaluable historical and cultural significance, but deciphering them can be a challenging and time-consuming task. This AI model streamlines the process by automating the extraction of letters from images, making the interpretation and analysis of ancient scripts more accessible to researchers and enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Utilizes OpenCV for preprocessing tasks such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and edge detection to improve the quality of input images.
- **Letter Extraction Algorithm**: Employs advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately isolate individual letters from complex backgrounds.
- **Sequential Presentation**: Presents extracted letters in a sequential manner, facilitating easy interpretation and analysis of the inscription text.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle images of varying resolutions and lighting conditions, making it suitable for a wide range of rock inscriptions.

## Usage

To use the AI model, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the main script `s4.ipynb` and provide the path to the image containing the rock inscription.
3. The AI model will process the image and extract the letters, which will be presented sequentially.
